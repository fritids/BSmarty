# [BSmarty](http://slapandthink.com/bsmarty)

BSmarty is a simple and a lightweight micro-CMS for fast, adaptable and light website and project.

This personal project is the product of many houres of development and knowledge.
I want to see if I was capable of creating a micro-CMS in MVC architecture, so the result is a very accessible developpment project and easy to extend.

The developpment is still in progress.

## Features

* HTML5 ready.
* Use of the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) front-end framework, for fast conception.
* Date picker, tablesort, AJAX Upload, SLUG generation.
* Designed with progressive enhancement in mind.
* Use PHP 5, Mysql, CSS3.
* Rewrite engine.
* File explorer module (AJAX upload).
* WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE).
* Shortcode integration.
* Blog post type.
* Page post type.
* Download module.
* Payment module (ATOS).
* Online order module.
* Menu generator (with drag and drop).
* Form generation.
* Email templating system
* User management (level)

* MVC architecture.

## Connection
By default, the admin area is: `domain.com/bs-admin` with the login/pass `admin/admin`.

## Documentation

I hope on day, I will publish a simple documentation for using this CMS, but now i haven't the time to do this.
When the documentation will be publish, it will storred on a [dedicate page](http://slapanthink.com/bsmarty)
However, the code is very basic and require no elevate knowledge for understanting it.
Furthermore, all the code is well commented, you shouldn't have any problem to understand it.
